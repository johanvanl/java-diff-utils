java-diff-utils
===============

A fork of [java-diff-utils](http://code.google.com/p/java-diff-utils/).

Have a look in DiffUtils.java for the functionality.

In this fork I added some useful methods in DiffUtils.java.

This project has no dependencies, it can be added directly to your current Java project and used by calling the static methods in Diffutils.java.
